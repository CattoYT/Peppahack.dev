  <center>Strike Fast, Place Fast. PeppaHack is a premium minecraft client, created for 1.12.2 anarchy and CrystalPvP. It is a custom client, created from the original Phobos Newbase SRC, created by Ohare(Colorblindness). It has been adjusted to fix as many bugs as possible and with the strongest AutoCrystal possible in Minecraft. Everything has been coded to bypass CrystalPvP servers of all varieties and even 2b2t and strict.2b2tpvp.org. We can assure that this is the client that YOU should buy.

<div id="Astra">
<center>Ascend to another plane of being. Astra Client is a new Hacked Client, made for 1.8.8. It is currently in development and may be a private client in the future. It will be made to bypass as many cracked servers as possible (mainly BlocksMC) and the Hypixel Network. With inspiration from the biggest clients in the market right now, there are beautiful visuals and bypases, completely unique to Astra. Development is currently paused as the main developer is working on side projects with other developers and the rest of the community.
