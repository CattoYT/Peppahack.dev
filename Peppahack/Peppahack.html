     <center>PeppaHack's modified AutoCrystal has been optimized in a way, never seen before. It has the best movement modules on 2b2tpvp and crystalpvp.cc. The visuals on this client are made to look like the beautiful older visuals on other clients like Nodus and a general older look. However, while it may look old, it is filled with the best modules in the community.
